Link to the GitHub repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/shadxx7/elections-frontend\">https://github.com/shadxx7/elections-frontend</a>. So let’s begin:</p>\n<h2>State Management</h2>\n<p>If you’ve learned React enough and for that matter any good JS front-end framework, you would know the importance of state management. Good state management is key to a scalable and flexible application.</p>\n<p>React allows you to use different state managing libraries, the most popular being Redux and as expected I also used it in this project but let me be clear, <strong>Redux is not always the answer</strong>. Now don’t get me wrong, Redux is great, but <em>yes the infamous but</em> its not meant for all projects. Redux, as it defines itself, is a “Predictable State Container”, which basically means that it enables you to maintain a global state throughout your React app and you can plug this state into any component you wish. All sounding great? The problem comes in when you realize the amount of overhead code you need to write to achieve this. Some would argue that what is the problem? The problem is that sometimes its just not necessary to maintain a global state and this, of course, varies with your use case, but I can’t tell how much time I would have saved if I decided to do things differently.</p>\n<p>So conclusion; don’t use Redux? No, its more like before deciding on a state library, its better to assess the needs of the app, study the different libraries like MobX or maybe even use React Context API and then finalize on what you want to use and where.</p>\n<h2>Testing</h2>\n<p>Testing, this single word is able to spring hateful emotions in millions of developers around the world. However you feel, I made the terrible mistake of avoiding it until I finished most of the application. At first, it never seems apparent to write tests for every little UI/function you add in your application, but when you are finalizing your application and need to perform full tests, it is painful to do them manually and also humanly impossible to cover all the different test cases, especially when it comes to UI testing. This is when you realize writing tests alongside writing your components comes in really handy. Currently, to write my tests, I’m using the <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro\">react-testing-library</a> and I found it great so far. Other libraries also exist, like Airbnb’s <a href=\"https://airbnb.io/enzyme/\">enzyme</a>.</p>\n<h2>Class and Functional Components</h2>\n<p>When starting out in React, everyone usually prefers class components over functional ones. I\ninitially also used class components everywhere. Then again, it only makes sense to, as React\nlife-cycle methods are only available to class components (this is assuming Hooks haven’t released),\nbut the use of functional components is very important. This is because they are just faster in terms\nof performance as compared to class components. They can make quite the difference when your pages\nget component heavy and additionally they look more cleaner in terms of code, hence increasing code\nreadability.</p>\n<h2>Nitty-gritties</h2>\n<p>Now with the smaller problems and mistakes;</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/278bf2e7ba194be4c05914e2412c6a13/a5d5c/react-hold.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.16438356164384%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"2\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/278bf2e7ba194be4c05914e2412c6a13/b9e4f/react-hold.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/278bf2e7ba194be4c05914e2412c6a13/cf440/react-hold.png 148w,\n/static/278bf2e7ba194be4c05914e2412c6a13/d2d38/react-hold.png 295w,\n/static/278bf2e7ba194be4c05914e2412c6a13/b9e4f/react-hold.png 590w,\n/static/278bf2e7ba194be4c05914e2412c6a13/f9b6a/react-hold.png 885w,\n/static/278bf2e7ba194be4c05914e2412c6a13/2d849/react-hold.png 1180w,\n/static/278bf2e7ba194be4c05914e2412c6a13/a5d5c/react-hold.png 1460w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h3>a.</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mistakes I Made in My First React App","date":"January 24, 2019","description":"I decided to write this article for all the people starting out with new React projects, in hope that it helps them in some way."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":null}}
