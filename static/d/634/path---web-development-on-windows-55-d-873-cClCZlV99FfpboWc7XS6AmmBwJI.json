But honestly, this has changed over the years as Windows has matured into what it is today.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This article assumes you are using Windows 10, however since Windows offers a decent amount of\nbackwards compatibility, you should be able to pull this off with an older version of Windows too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Terminal</h2>\n<p>Lets get started with the terminal. The terminal will be extensively used as you will be using a wholesome of different CLIs (Command Line Interfaces, like npm). Primarily you should be using PowerShell and bash (Iâ€™ll get to this) with a wrapper like <a href=\"https://hyper.is/\">hyper</a>. Hyper is electron-based terminal built on HTML/CSS/JS. It has loads of extensions to add utility and themes to lavish your experience.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/23593/terminal.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 64.13469068128425%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"1\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/c739e/terminal.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/8ee9c/terminal.jpg 148w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/ebbe7/terminal.jpg 295w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/c739e/terminal.jpg 590w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/5413e/terminal.jpg 885w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/4efde/terminal.jpg 1180w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/23593/terminal.jpg 1277w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve mentioned the use of bash. Yes, you can install bash on windows and no itâ€™s not a gimmick or some half-baked thing, its the real deal. Meet the Windows Subsystem for Linux (This feature was added to one of the later versions of Windows 10). <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10\">Here</a> is how to install it. You should use bash whenever PowerShell is giving you unheeded trouble. Remember that when you run bash, its a completely different OS running somewhere on your windows and therefore you need to make fresh installations of all your CLIs using the appropriate commands(depends on which Linux installation you choose).</p>\n<h2>Handy Tools</h2>\n<p>Moving on letâ€™s install a command-line installer. This is quite handy for doing quick installs of different tools. The 2 most popular options on windows are <a href=\"https://scoop.sh/\">Scoop</a> and <a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/\">Chocolatey</a>. I personally prefer Scoop, because of its more minimal operation, but you couldnâ€™t go wrong with either(installing both is also an option). These let you install things like Node, Python etc. in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<p>Next, we need to pick a good web package manager. Again the 2 most popular ones are npm and yarn. npm will be installed by default when you install Node.js. You can install yarn here. Yarn uses npmâ€™s package repository, the only difference being is the way it handles dependencies and its performance (You can read more about the differences on its website). I personally use yarn, but you cannot go wrong with either. There is one more package manager which is not used anymore (but is maintained), but I think Iâ€™ll mention it anyway; bower.</p>\n<p>Also having Git installed is kind of necessary as it serve as the backbone of most modern web projects and for that matter any development project ðŸ˜œ(<a href=\"https://medium.com/code-dementia/why-and-how-you-should-start-using-git-github-right-now-28617df72545\">Here</a> is a guide on Git and GitHub by Hemant Jain). Finally, you might come across a few errors due to missing build tools. These are the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools\">windows-build-tools</a>, which are some modules necessary for compiling, running and building different stuff. While Iâ€™m not clear on exactly what modules this package contains, it has helped me avoid a lot of errors when I was trying out new stuff and is mandatory for a lot of different projects. You can simply install them by running:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> install--global</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Development on Windows","date":"March 24, 2019","description":"In popular belief, Windows is not preferred to do web development on and for that matter any kind of development.
