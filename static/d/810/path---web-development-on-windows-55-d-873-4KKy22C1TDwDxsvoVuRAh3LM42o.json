But honestly, this has changed over the years as Windows has matured into what it is today.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This article assumes you are using Windows 10, however since Windows offers a decent amount of\nbackwards compatibility, you should be able to pull this off with an older version of Windows too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Terminal</h2>\n<p>Lets get started with the terminal. The terminal will be extensively used as you will be using a wholesome of different CLIs (Command Line Interfaces, like npm). Primarily you should be using PowerShell and bash (I’ll get to this) with a wrapper like <a href=\"\">hyper</a>. Hyper is electron-based terminal built on HTML/CSS/JS. It has loads of extensions to add utility and themes to lavish your experience.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/23593/terminal.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 64.13469068128425%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"1\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/c739e/terminal.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/8ee9c/terminal.jpg 148w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/ebbe7/terminal.jpg 295w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/c739e/terminal.jpg 590w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/5413e/terminal.jpg 885w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/4efde/terminal.jpg 1180w,\n/static/bcb530713df7a245c70588158e905ca5/23593/terminal.jpg 1277w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I’ve mentioned the use of bash. Yes, you can install bash on windows and no it’s not a gimmick or some half-baked thing, its the real deal. Meet the Windows Subsystem for Linux (This feature was added to one of the later versions of Windows 10). Here is how to install it. You should use bash whenever PowerShell is giving you unheeded trouble. Remember that when you run bash, its a completely different OS running somewhere on your windows and therefore you need to make fresh installations of all your CLIs using the appropriate commands(depends on which Linux installation you choose).</p>\n<h2>Handy Tools</h2>\n<p>Testing, this single word is able to spring hateful emotions in millions of developers around the world. However you feel, I made the terrible mistake of avoiding it until I finished most of the application. At first, it never seems apparent to write tests for every little UI/function you add in your application, but when you are finalizing your application and need to perform full tests, it is painful to do them manually and also humanly impossible to cover all the different test cases, especially when it comes to UI testing. This is when you realize writing tests alongside writing your components comes in really handy. Currently, to write my tests, I’m using the <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro\">react-testing-library</a> and I found it great so far. Other libraries also exist, like Airbnb’s <a href=\"https://airbnb.io/enzyme/\">enzyme</a>.</p>\n<h2>Class and Functional Components</h2>\n<p>When starting out in React, everyone usually prefers class components over functional ones. I\ninitially also used class components everywhere. Then again, it only makes sense to, as React\nlife-cycle methods are only available to class components (this is assuming Hooks haven’t released),\nbut the use of functional components is very important. This is because they are just faster in terms\nof performance as compared to class components. They can make quite the difference when your pages\nget component heavy and additionally they look more cleaner in terms of code, hence increasing code\nreadability.</p>\n<h2>Nitty-gritties</h2>\n<p>Now with the smaller problems and mistakes;</p>\n<p><img src=\"./react-hold.png\" alt=\"2\"></p>\n<h3>a. Trying to render empty functions</h3>\n<p>This mistake wasted hours of my life. Basically, when you try to render a class function like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token function-variable function\">renderFields</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> currentCommittee <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>props<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>poll<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>currentCommittee<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>currrentCommittee<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\nrender <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">\n              </span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">renderFields</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token plain-text\">\n        </span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>It will return an error if the props haven’t loaded on the first render, meaning that if you are loading props with any kind of delay (for example — from your back-end) the above code, breaks. The quick fix for this is to use the lodash library’s ‘get’ function and make a quick check if the prop has loaded or not, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\">render <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>_<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">get</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>currentCommittee<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"candidates\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">renderFields</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>b. Folder structure and Naming Scheme</h3>\n<p>It’s necessary to have a good folder structure but wasting too much time on it is unnecessary. Simply deciding on the popular choices and then tweaking it a little according to your needs should do the job. The one I finally followed was:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"txt\"><pre class=\"language-txt\"><code class=\"language-txt\">/src\n  /assets\n  /components\n  /store\n  /style\n  /tests\n/utils</code></pre></div>\n<p>/assets for images, icons etc. /components for all my components, /store for my Redux store and actions, /style for all css files, /tests for all the tests and /utils for some extra utility function files.</p>\n<p>I recommend not to put css files in an independent style folder, instead just drop them in their respective component folder.</p>\n<p>For naming component files and folders, I initially followed the Snake case (hello_world) naming method owing to the redundant python projects I’ve done. The problem in using this naming scheme in React projects is that it doesn’t sit well with the strict Pascal case (HelloWorld) used in naming React components in JSX. Therefore to avoid further confusion and to satisfy my OCD, I switched back all my component files and folders to Pascal case.</p>\n<h3>c. Using Modern React</h3>\n<p>React is being frequently updated with new features and improvements and this shouldn’t be news as it is currently the most popular JavaScript front-end framework. Although the core React team rarely introduces breaking changes, its imperative to keep up with the newest changes as to have the best performing applications. On just the course of this project, there were over 10 releases of React. At this point in time, what I would call modern React would be the React Context API, React Suspense, React Hooks, React Concurrent etc. Primarily, I felt that I could’ve used the React Context API to replace most of the Redux I’ve used which would have saved a lot of my time.</p>\n<h3>d. Should’ve used Typescript? Maybe.</h3>\n<p>So, at the time of writing this article, I’ve already learnt typescript and I see it’s importance clearly. There isn’t too much I can explain directly from the project, but here’s what I have to say; Typescript definitely helps a lot especially with larger projects. Yes, it does add a little bit of overhead code but writing that extra code is what you’ll prefer over a stream of errors related to types on which you’ll waste hours debugging.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>Are these all the mistakes I made? No, of course not, there were many others, but I don’t think they are worth mentioning, mostly because they were either caused by my stupidity or were unavoidable.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Development on Windows","date":"March 24, 2019","description":"In popular belief, Windows is not preferred to do web development on and for that matter any kind of development.
